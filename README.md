# NYC-Infrastructure-And-Temperature

The aim of this project is to develop a map visualizing different types of infrastructure (parks, roadbeds, pavements, parking structures, swimming pools, etc.) in NYC, overlay those with temperature data collected from the NASA LANDSAT 8 Satellite and quantitatively analyze any temperature differences.
